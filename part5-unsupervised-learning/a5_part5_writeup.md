# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

orange woud be "saver" because they have a larger income, but don't spend that much
red would be "frugal" because they have a smaller income, and don't spend that much
green is "shopaholic" because they have a larger income, and spend a lot
blue is "average consumer" because they have a pretty middle of the road income, and middle of the road spending habits
purple is "STOP! YOU NEED TO PAY RENT!" because they have a small income, but spend a lot

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
probably blue, but on the lower end. potenttialy between red and orange.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
to target the purple group, marketing teams may advertise several cheap items to them. because of their low income, they won't be able to purchse very expensive items, but they clearly want to spend money, makeing it so a high volue of cheap products is the best way to advertise to this group.
