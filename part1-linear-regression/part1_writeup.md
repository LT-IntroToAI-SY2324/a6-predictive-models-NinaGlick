After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
the r squared value is .626. Ths means that the graph is linear.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
A person wh is 43 will have a heart rate of roughly 137.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I do not think it's that accurate. I think that the model works, but te data se is off. if the data set is made more accurate, the model sould work better.
